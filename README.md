# Noroff - Project Exam 2

## Introduction

This repository is for my Exam Project, for my final year at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media.
Where I have been studying frond-end development.

## Project brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
